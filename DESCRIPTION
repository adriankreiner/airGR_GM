Description: This package is a modification based on the airGR package version 1.7.6, developed to include glacier ablation in addition to the existing suite of conceptual rainfall-runoff models. The original airGR package, developed by INRAE-Antony (HYCAR Research Unit, France), includes models like GR4H, GR5H, GR4J, GR5J, GR6J, GR2M, GR1A, and the snow accumulation and melt model (CemaNeige). The original airGR package can be found on CRAN at the URL provided below.
